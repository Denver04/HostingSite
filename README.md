# Simon Buzzer Game
It is a simple game which I made using JavaScript , HTML , JQuery. It is good to build cncentration and also helps in increasing the memory power.

In this game, I also put sound to each of the different buzzer so that it looks more attractive and become more enjoyable
If you follow the wrong pattern it gives you a RED buzzer , where you have to restart again.
Level also gets increasing as you progress the game.
